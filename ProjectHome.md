# Android SMS Banking Helper #

## What is SMS Banking? ##
SMS Banking is a feature available in certain banks: users are allowed to send simple structured text messages to trigger certain actions with their bank account. For example:
  1. SMS "BAL 1234" is sent to certain phone number (bank's one)
  1. This is an instructoin to your bank - "Send me my balance. My SMS Banking PIN code is 1234".
  1. Your bank sends you an SMS "OK:BALANCE=987".
  1. Which you understand as "Your message was processed all right, and you current balance is 987". You should probabaly know the currency of your account... :)

## What's in it for me? ##
Android SMS Banking Helper (shortly, "SMS Bank") is basically an SMS templating application, and a tool to automatically process the SMS you get in a reply. However, unlike regular SMS templating applicatios is also enables you with the followinng features:
  * Enhanced secutiry. Nobody can access your SMS Banking PIN code, or find out your list of SMS Banking subscriptions (aka action codes, like "BAL" from the example above). PIN code and templates are entered once only, and are stored securely.
  * Easy access to SMS Bankign features. Once configured, you can trigger actions with just a single tap on a screen, and receive the reply in a human-readable form at once.
